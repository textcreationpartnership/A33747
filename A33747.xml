            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Though their own Worth may not be great, what they preſent You with, I am ſure, is juſtly valuable. The Ambitious and the Covetous may here feed both their Deſires; the one may be ennobled, the other enriched: You are told how to ſeek, and invited to lay hold on Crowns of Glory, and Riches not to be exhauſted: You are taught how to adde to an Earthly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance conveyed down to You by Your Anceſtors, an Inheritance better and ſafer; a Land flowing with Milk and Honey, with the richeſt Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and the delicious Overflowings of unbounded Joys. In the next place, to all them whom Diſcoveries pleaſe, here is given the Greateſt, and the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt, and the moſt Neceſſary beſides.
<pb facs="tcp:61162:4"/> And laſtly, if they chance but to meet with Sanguine Readers, ſuch as are taken with Compoſures of this nature, and are of a Temper that is Soft and Paſſionate, as they are the moſt proper for, ſo are they the moſt likely of any to move theſe: Yet if this cannot be done, it will be well enough, if they can do no more but detain ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons a little while from what is worſe.</p>

                        <p>You, among the reſt, may challenge no ſmall Propriety herein.

                     <p>MAny years had this Reverend Sire ſeen paſs over his head, all which were ſpent in the exerciſes of his duty, and ſanctified by the ſeverities of a ſtrict Piety and an holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; many brave heroick Atchievements he had performed; nothing he leſt undone to bring back the diſſolute Worldlings from out the ways of ſin and errour, of blindneſs and an undiſcerned death; he had gallantry of Soul enough to ſtand in the <hi>Gap</hi> againſt all oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and boldly to reſiſt the deviation in the Multitude; and he ſtrove as much as <hi>in him lay,</hi> to reduce the Church, under which he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, into its <hi>primitive</hi> Order and Purity.</p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:61162:34"/>
                     <p>Now finding all his pains and methods <hi>ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſleſs,</hi> himſelf lying under an heavy <hi>Interdict</hi> of the uſurping <hi>Senate,</hi> and ready to be baniſht the Iſland <hi>Albina,</hi> he reſolves to withdraw a little, and hide himſelf in the cloſe retreats of a <hi>Country</hi>-Shade; there to try in the laſt place whether or no the ruſtick <hi>Boors</hi> and <hi>Shepherds</hi> had forgot their honeſt ſimplicity, ſhaken off their old <hi>rural</hi> Innocence and Plainneſs.</p>
                     <p>Several leagues had he left behind the Royal City <hi>Megalopolis,</hi> and having paſſed above a days journey through nought but deſolate and waſte grounds, he came at laſt into a moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Plain, or Grove, or Garden, call it which you pleaſe, overlooked by the tops of the Hills, and ſhaded by the pretty wild diſorder of the Trees; which made it appear the Seat of pleaſant Solitarineſs and delightful Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:61162:35"/> glad to find himſelf at laſt a reſling place, in which he thought to ſpend the poor remainder of his days. And deſigned (as did heretofore the <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 21. 33.</note> firſt Father of Religious Pilgrims) to conſecrate this <hi>Grove</hi> into a <hi>Temple,</hi> and turn every <hi>Tree</hi> into an <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,</hi> uſing the Boughs for <hi>Hoſanna's</hi> to the Son of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> of the way to thoſe that follow after.</p>
                     <p>Here the penſive and melancholy Hermit delighted to walk; and ſtill at every ſtep he made ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs <note place="margin">The Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Life.</note> towards a better and a more laſting Scene of Pleaſures. Every thing he ſaw, added fuel to the pious ardours of his Soul, cauſed him to long for the Manſions of Eternity; that Spiritual <hi>Eden</hi> which he beheld faintly, as it were, reflected upon this ſpot of Land: <hi>Sometimes</hi> would he liſten to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the little chanting Birds, thoſe vocal Choriſters of the Air, and with them joyn concert in a ſprightly Carol to the King of Heaven: And <hi>ſometimes</hi> again the bleating innocent <hi>Animals</hi> that were grazing upon the neighbouring Hills, made him pity his own diſconſolate and ſcattered <hi>Flock</hi> (committed to him indeed by the good Shepherd of Men, but) rapaciouſly ſtollen from him ſome while ſince by Thieves in a <hi>Paſtoral</hi> diſguiſe.

So now he had two Worlds, and two Suns to contemplate; the one <hi>real,</hi> the other <hi>reflected:</hi> Which made him with ſorrow think of thoſe poor Souls who care not to look <hi>up</hi> ſo high as the Paradiſe in the higheſt Heavens, where are the onely <hi>real</hi> and <hi>permanent</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Felicity; but <hi>downward</hi> upon one that is no other but <hi>reflected</hi> and <hi>imaginary:</hi> Which whilſt they ſtrive to obtain, they do but graſp the very appearance of a watry <hi>Shadow,</hi> and thereby fooliſhly drown and deſtroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; meeting with, inſtead of Happineſs, a diſmal Diſappointment, cold unexpected Death. But quite otherwiſe, theſe ſhadowy Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations made him the better fix his mind upon Realities: theſe ſcanty Streams, ſhallow Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Currents, could ſend him to the Waters
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:61162:36"/> above the Firmament, the Rivers of Delight which are at Gods right hand. So that, by contemplation <hi>on</hi> and foretaſte <hi>of</hi> thoſe Joys a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, he almoſt thinks himſelf already here <hi>imparadiſed;</hi> which Solitude would the rather perſwade him to think no miſtake: Here <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Hiddekel, Gihon</hi> and <hi>Phrath,</hi> were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eyes. Nay, every <hi>Plant,</hi> every ſpire of <hi>Graſs,</hi> the moſt neglected <hi>Flower,</hi> the moſt ordinary <hi>Herb,</hi> the ſmalleſt <hi>Inſect,</hi> had all ſome kind of <hi>Image</hi> of a <hi>Deity enſtamped</hi> on them. There was ſomewhat of Paradiſe he fancied in whatever he ſaw; and well might that place be counted Paradiſe, which could boaſt of the truly vertuous <hi>THEOSOPH<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S,</hi> (ſo was <hi>he</hi> called.) In this manner viewing a pleaſant Vale, which another might perhaps have looked upon barely to feed his eye, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create his ſenſe, he drew thence a <hi>Map</hi> of the <hi>Celeſtial Temple.</hi> Whereof he was thus alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy poſſeſt in <hi>imagination</hi> and <hi>picture.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now it happened as he was thus meditating with himſelf, he lighted unawares into a Path. He ſtrait knew himſelf miſtaken concerning the lonelineſs of the place; which he was ſoon further convinced of by reading ſeveral ſmall Hiſtories of Chriſtian Palmers and religious Conferences, cut in the rindes of the Trees, with the names of <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> and <hi>ORTHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOXUS</hi> underwritten; many Hymns and

                     </p>
                     <p>Hence the Pious Father over-joyful, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently knew that it muſt needs be the Retreat of theſe his Friendly Coadjutors; and big with hopes, expected to find them here. And ſo he did: For not long had he ſought them, before he heard the hacking of Axes hewing down the Trees all round about, and obſerved the narrow Rivulets to begin to be tainted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturally with a bloudy colour; when not far off he could deſcry his three deareſt Friends, with their hands bound, hurried away Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, followed with ſhouts and reviling accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations; with loud outeries of Hereſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the moſt moderate and learned <hi>ORTHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOX<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> againſt <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>L<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> of diſtaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pernicious Advice; and impure and doggril Rhymes they, as maliciouſly, laid to divine <hi>

                     <p>One would have thought, that to have ones greateſt and fierceſt <hi>hopes</hi> thus on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diſappointed, had been enough to caſt a ſad <hi>damp</hi> over the moſt courageous Spirit that ever was.

                     <p>Here were two Princes fighting for a little

Next moved huge floating I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlands built onely for deſtruction: for as if the Sea, the Storms, and fury of meeting Winds, Hurricanes, Travadoes, Swallows, Whirlpools, Rocks, Quick-ſands, Banks, Waſhes, Oaz, Leaks, and all Miſchances, with Pyrates both <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> were not enough, bloudy Battles muſt be fought even there, lives periſh which the <hi>guiltleſs</hi> Element conſents not unto, and all ſorts of death made to combine with mans wickedneſs, <hi>fire</hi> it ſelf to rage upon the <hi>Waters;</hi> for no other end, but that more Bloud may be ſo ſhed than the very Ocean can purge away.

                     <p>Then next he obſerved, by moving the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcope before his eyes a little back to ſeek out again where he <note place="margin">Blindneſs and Error.</note> had beheld the Scene of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Madneſs, ſeveral Companies of unlucky Paſſengers travelling by, miſ-led out of the way, bewilder'd by <hi>ignes fatui,</hi> by falſe Lights, and treacherous Leaders: And amongſt them he could not but ſadly lament the froward and unweildy Zeal of his own Country-men, ſet on fire by the diſhoneſty and impoſture of their Guides.

Some out of their profound prudence, made themſelves blind, purpoſely that they might avoid thoſe Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices they were in danger of; and thought they ſhould ſee better with <hi>anothers</hi> Eyes, than with their <hi>own</hi> they could before; and that the way to <hi>ſhun</hi> the Blocks of ſtumbling which were lain ſo thick in the Road, was to be uncapable of ſeeing them: Others did the ſame, that they might the more <hi>ſecurely</hi> erre, and through an <hi>affected</hi> ignorance of their duty, plead <hi>not guilty</hi> to its omiſſion; juſt as if a Malefactor ſhould think to ſave his Neck, in refuſing to learn what the <hi>Law</hi> makes death.

                     <p>The Armies covered the Land like Locuſts, and with their Multitudes made a Night wherein none of the Lights <note place="margin">The Victory.</note> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> or of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> were ſeen: the Pomps of the <hi>World,</hi> the Luſts of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> the Luſts of the <hi>Eye,</hi> all ſtanding in ſtately Array, were prepared for the Battel, but with the

There were Sins of Youth allotted, and others deputed to catch thoſe of riper age; but that now and then youthful pleaſure and a ſhrivell'd face went together, and childiſh dotage made the old man laughed at. Oppreſſion, Extortion, Sacriledge, and Rapine, went over to the more powerful: Falſe Surmiſings, Jealouſie, Unfaithfulneſs, choſe to dwell with Friends; Deceit with Tradeſmen; and unpuniſht Murther in Meats and Drinks, at rich Tables and large Cellars, in the Shops both of Luxury and Medicine: The <hi>Viper</hi> was bad to lurk within the <hi>bed</hi> of the Harlot, and the Fox to ſend his <hi>fur</hi> to line the Stateſmans Gown: The <hi>muddy</hi> Souls of ſome were pleaſed beſt with filthy and obſcene Delights; the <hi>ſhrewd</hi> Brains of others beſt

Not a few ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the <hi>Barren,</hi> and many more the <hi>Fertile</hi> Soil: Some took up their Quarters in the <hi>well,</hi> and others in the <hi>ill-timber'd</hi> Body: Some would lay in thoſe Heads that were <hi>ſoft,</hi> and others in thoſe that were <hi>hard:</hi> Some liked to dwell in a <hi>thick,</hi> but others liked a <hi>thin</hi> Scull better: Many ſet upon the <hi>glib</hi> Tongue, and a few upon the <hi>tyed:</hi> There were thoſe that were ſent to plunder the <hi>Sick,</hi> and thoſe the <hi>Healthy:</hi> There were thoſe that would live upon the <hi>Rich,</hi> and others upon the <hi>Poor;</hi> upon the <hi>great</hi> men, and the <hi>ſmall;</hi> in <hi>much</hi> Bloud, or <hi>little;</hi> in an <hi>hot,</hi> or <hi>cold</hi> Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

The Mutinous and the Quarrelſome, the Vain and the Fickle, the Buffoon, the Apiſh, and the Licentious, the Adulterer and Inceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the Blaſphemer and the Apoſtate, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricide and the Aſſaſſin, the Felon and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor, the Ungrateful and the Perfidious, the Inhumane, the Uncharitable, and the Simoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ack, the open Rebel and the cloſe Conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; were all coaks'd into the World's <hi>ſtrongeſt</hi> Net, and had the mark of the Beaſt burnt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their foreheads more than ordinarily viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Thus being <hi>ſealed</hi> by their beloved Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, after a little while of ſport and play, they were pinched and griped, and their brains knocked out one againſt another, and then ſent for a Preſent to the other World. For they would allow ſome of them time to frolick in, before they ſhew'd them the Axes and the Halters: knew how (after the <hi>Perſian</hi> mode) to dreſs up a Mock-Prince to be played with, and with ſuch formalities barbarouſly to ſport at thoſe whom they had ſentenced tardy. Theſe Tyrants forced ſome to rejoyce, as they forced others to mourn; but thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced came at laſt to mourn moſt: they
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61162:49"/> killed theſe with ſinging and roaring; they deſtroyed others with fretting and pulling: they lowred upon ſome, but ſmiled upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as they were ſticking them into the heart: they feared ſome Conſciences hard, but burned others ſore and tender; thoſe were not afraid to act any thing <hi>unlawful,</hi> while theſe on the other ſide were afraid to act what was <hi>lawful.</hi> Thus they hamper'd both the Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and the Uneaſie. Some of their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives foamed at mouth, as if they were all in a ferment; others ſparkled, as if they were on fire; and others looked black and ghaſtly as any Carrion. Indignation, Diſdain, Deſpite, Scorn, Envy, Revenge, Outrage, Repinings, with a number of ſuch-like Affections, disfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured the faces of a great many: this mans heart was canker'd with inward Rancor; the others feſter'd ſorely with Carking and vain Solicitude: they pricked ſome to death with Needles, (theſe were they whoſe uncontented<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would not ſuffer them to reſt quiet) and run others through with red-hot Irons (theſe were they whoſe Fleſh was corrupted, and whoſe Marrow was burnt up within their bones.) Thus the <hi>Furies</hi> divided the Spoils a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, laid waſte the Lands, and <hi>treacherouſly</hi> killed the poor Captives, to whom they had promiſed <hi>Quarter.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Deſire</hi> (and that too always followed by <hi>Loathings)</hi>
                        <pb n="85" facs="tcp:61162:49"/> made them greedily ſwallow down the poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Baits.</hi>

                     <p>Nay, both the Extremes hugged themſelves together againſt <hi>Man.</hi> In the <hi>Gentile</hi> Sinner, the fine ſparkiſh <note place="margin">Oppoſites made Friends.</note> Gallant, he obſerved a beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Foppery and Court-Flattery: but in the <hi>Clown,</hi> Rudeneſſes and Incivilities, Roughneſs and a rugged ill-natur'd Untractableneſs. One was Fool-hardy; another Fool-wary. He was too Rigorous, but the other over-Eaſie; and both thereby <hi>alike</hi> hurtful unto Virtue. So much Knavery could not <hi>rid</hi> the Multitude of Folly, nor Cowardiſe of Temerity. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and the Deceived, the Blockiſh and the Crafty, the Fantaſtical and the Moroſe, lived near together, and were <hi>beholding</hi> to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for what they were. The Knave led the Fool by the Noſe, till he himſelf was at laſt caught in the <hi>Gin,</hi> and by tearing himſelf flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered to get out, but could not. There were both the Deſpairing and the Deſperate, who preſented themſelves to his view: the former deſponded of every thing, the latter of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and <hi>paſt</hi> Deſpair, durſt ſet upon <hi>Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities;</hi> whereas thoſe <hi>through</hi> Fear durſt not ſet upon the greateſt <hi>Poſſibilities.</hi> Affectation dreſſed up more than a few to be <hi>laughed</hi> at, and Indecence as many to be <hi>trodden</hi> on.

Treachery combined with over-much Officiouſneſs, and mean Condeſcentions went along with them to <hi>ſupport</hi> Tyranny; Diffidence &amp; fooliſh Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption hand in hand; much Talk and peeviſh Silence, looſer Laughter and a Weeping-fit, mutually ſucceeding each other. Thus even Contrarieties conſpired againſt a weak Race, were reconciled to do Man an <hi>Injury.</hi> But though ſome were ſo modeſt as but to ſcatter up and down among the leaſt number of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries; he could ſee light and unſettled Spirits, Selfiſhneſs, littleneſs of Mind, a love of the World, Impoſture and Blindneſs in every place; with Machivellian Policy, the Devices and Slights of cunning Cheats ſent to impoſe upon the World, Maſſacres, Plots, Factions, Rebellions—.

                        <hi>I ſee it is juſt ſo: no Victory is now held ſo honourable as to overcome ones Reaſon, and baffle Conſcience; nor Conqueſt ſo deſerving as everlaſtingly to overthrow</hi> one ſelf. <hi>See, how far the Triumphs of that bewitching</hi> Siren <hi>(ſinful Folly) are extended!

But all in vain; he met with ſo fierce (ſo much the more fierce as the more unexpected) oppoſition from theſe beſotted Clowns. Inſtead of Simplicity he meets with Bluntneſs, and a reſolute ill-grounded Refuſal: ſo far are they from being perſwaded by the plainneſs and the truth of his Diſcourſe, or at all better'd by his ſober Admonitions, that ſome of them revile, and others jeer, and every one deſpiſeth him.</p>

                        <p>His Viſion.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN <hi>ſuch</hi> ſort did the <hi>dejected</hi> Eremit pour forth his Soul upon the Banks of the River <hi>Thamus</hi> (whoſe <hi>becrimſon'd</hi> ſtreams well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough accorded with his <hi>Wo,</hi> and whoſe waves ſeemed to <hi>liſten</hi> to his words, and then rejoyce to <hi>report</hi> them to each other in <hi>ſorrowfully</hi>-pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Eccho's,) till by the rowling <hi>murmurs</hi> of the Current, and the heavineſs and ſorrows of his <hi>wearied</hi> Spirits, he was eaſily compelled to take the <hi>reſpite</hi> of a little ſleep.</p>
                     <p>But his Imagination ſuffered him not to reſt: for no ſooner had he let his Senſes go, but he thought he ſaw a <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>ſtately</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple raiſed ſuddenly by the hands of <hi>Angels;</hi> the Materials and Stones whereof were taken out of the <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Quarries, and the <hi>Sun</hi> glittering againſt the Walls, rendered it above meaſure <hi>reſplendent:</hi> which frightened away an ugly <hi>Pore-blind</hi> Hag that had hid her ſelf under the Ground-work, not able to abide ſo dazling a <hi>Luſtre.</hi> For ſhe loved to converſe with <hi>Bats</hi> and <hi>Screech-Owls,</hi> her Eyes being too <hi>weak</hi> to endure the <hi>Light,</hi> or even without
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61162:57"/> violence the leaſt <hi>gleam</hi> thereof; ſo hateful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her, that to obſcure the ſame, out of her mouth ſhe continually <hi>belched</hi> forth <hi>foggie</hi> Exhalations, and <hi>muffled</hi> her head round with groſs <hi>palpable</hi> Darkneſs; by which he knew her to be IGNORANCE: the miſtaken <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of miſtaken <hi>Devotion.</hi> He was for ſome while delighted, he ſaid, to view the glory and magnificence of this <hi>divine</hi> Structure, and to behold the <hi>chaſe</hi> of that blind deceiving Witch.</p>
                     <p>But at laſt he ſaw the <hi>Clouds</hi> begin to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves together very thick, and the <hi>Sun</hi> ſtrait to hide his head, and <hi>Ignorance</hi> again return. When he obſerved a great many ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king <hi>Battery</hi> againſt it. But others there were he perceived <hi>undermining</hi> the Foundation: and withal ſome helliſh Spirits not far off, who <hi>yelled</hi> hideouſly at his <hi>beauteous</hi> Decency, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a <hi>Storm</hi> which beat againſt it, <hi>ſhaking</hi> the ſtones ſo, that the <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderminers</hi> more eaſily o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrew it; and nothing preſently was left but the Ruines of this (once) <hi>goodly</hi> Fabrick. Than which, nothing could <hi>move</hi> the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Dreamer more. But the Air at length <hi>clearing</hi> up, and the Fogs diſpelled by the bright Rays of Truth (the <hi>Sun)</hi> this ſame Temple (that but lately fell) again appears to him in <hi>greater</hi> beauty and ſplendour; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe <hi>Portal</hi> he read, <hi>The CHAPPEL of</hi>
                        <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61162:57"/> 
                        <hi>the Pilgrims to the HOLY LAND.</hi> During the while, there touched his ear a ſad pleaſing harmony of elegiack and mournful Notes in a moſt ſoft melodious Air. All which was clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in a <hi>ſudden</hi> turn with quick and joyful <hi>Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs.</hi> And as he lookt to know whence it came, not <hi>yet</hi> recover'd of his penſive ſadneſs, he ſaw a winged Youth, as quick as Lightning, pierce the Sky, who <hi>ſmilingly</hi> approaching him, touched him with his wings; and ſhewing him a Mitre richly <hi>ſet</hi> with curious ſtones, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly held up, having this Inſcription, <hi>To him that leadeth;</hi> thus, with a countenance darting forth beams of joy, ſpake, <hi>viz. Why art thou, Son of Man, thus heavy and cast down, as if thy God had</hi> forſaken <hi>thee? I have hitherto (though unſeen) ſtill attended on and guarded thy perſon; but am now ſpecially commanded from him who is thus ſolicitous for you, to raiſe up your drooping Spirits, and to</hi> aſſure <hi>you that your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are accepted with him, and that after</hi> many <hi>diſappointments, hazards, and perils of life</hi> it ſelf, <hi>you ſhall find a</hi> ſelect <hi>number ready to bear you company unto</hi> thoſe <hi>yonder happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Immortality, where I, my</hi> dear <hi>Charge, expect at last to ſee you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having ſaid this, his Guardian <hi>Genius</hi> (who had <hi>ordered</hi> all theſe Shadows, and <hi>preſented</hi> them to his Imagination) diſappear'd, leaving in his veins for a long while after, ſuch a ſecret
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:61162:58"/> joy, as made all his bloud leap; and ſuch a calmneſs in his Soul, as made him quite forget his paſt diſcomforts.</p>
                     <p>However, he was ſomewhat <hi>ſtartled</hi> after this, at the ſight of a dead Corpſe before his feet, beginning to move and ſtand upright.</p>
                     <p>This broke the Chains of Sleep, ſetting his ſenſes and thoughts at liberty to <hi>reflect</hi> upon what he had ſeen. All which (except the motion of the dead Corpſe) when he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the ſweet comfortable words of his Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar <hi>Angel,</hi> admitted of an <hi>eaſie</hi> interpretation. The ſubverſion of the Church, and re-edifying thereof, the Mines under the Foundation, the yelling of Devils, the Tempeſt, the return of <hi>Ignorance,</hi> the glorious Mitre, and the dolorous Muſick, concluded with divine and ſprightly <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> were all <hi>obvious</hi> to make out. Onely this appearance of the Carcaſs ſeemed to <hi>forebode</hi> ſome ſudden <hi>Evil,</hi> which he would fain have underſtood.</p>

                     <p>NOw upon the ſhore, not far from him, lay a ſmall <hi>Casket,</hi> thrown up, as it were, by the flowings in of the Tyde.

O my</hi> Eubulus, <hi>have I then lost thee? What</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el <hi>hand has thus bereaved me of my Friend? Was it this the Corpſe portended? Well, be it ſo, yet grieve I will not.

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus ſaid he to himſelf, and then breaking it open, the firſt thing treaſur'd there he met
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:61162:59"/> with, was a fair rich Manuſcript of the <hi>two</hi> Covenants in their Original Languages, with an antient Liturgical Form of Prayer annext thereunto.

                     <p>Now at the name of <hi>Baſilius, Theoſophus</hi> his heart beat very much; yet he was unwilling to interrupt them, and thought it better to wait a little longer to ſee how they would break up their Diſcourſe. <hi>What</hi> (ſaid <hi>Theophilus) is this your News?

                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:61162:62"/> who heard diſtinctly enough what they ſaid, was ſomewhat ſurpriz'd at this, and more when <hi>Theophilus</hi> looking after the Box, ſpake thus to <hi>Parthenius: I remember I laid it there, you ſaw me, did not you? how can it then be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved away? for I have ſeen no body walking here. Sure I have not lost it: I would not have it lost for ever ſo much. The Effigie of the holy Lamb makes me think there is ſomewhat in it worthy to be prized. Did not you,</hi> Parthenius, <hi>take it up? tell me if you have.</hi> But <hi>Parthenius</hi> aſſured him he had not; and <hi>Theophilus</hi> knew not how to diſ-believe <hi>Parthenius,</hi> though he could not ſee any other probability, but that <hi>Parthenius</hi> had taken it up and laid it ſomewhere elſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Theoſophus,</hi> now to put an end to this, went towards the Tree under which they ſate, near unto the place he had taken up thoſe ſacred Treaſures. They both roſe up to reverence him; but <hi>Theophilus</hi> thereat ſtartled, looking about him as if he had loſt ſomething and could not find it, very ingenuouſly confeſſed, <hi>Sir, I was to ſearch out you, and give you a Box, which I ſaw one afar off (whom I ſuppoſed to have been either</hi> Orthodoxus <hi>or</hi> Eubulus) <hi>throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the River. I made haſte to take it up, which when I had taken up and looked upon, I knew whoſe it was, and eſteemed it as much as if I had ſaved a little</hi> Moſes <hi>(and perhaps I did) in his Ark, floating on the waters. I deſigned therefore</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:61162:62"/> 
                        <hi>to bring it you, my good Father: there, there it was I laid it down, thinking no body to be here; but now I ſee it is gone. Pray have you met any one with ſuch a little Box, walking this way, that I may enquire after, and if it be poſſible regain, the ſame? At this,</hi> ſaid the old Father, <hi>do not trouble your ſelf, ſweet</hi> Theophilus, <hi>for he whom you deſigned to have it, has it already; and</hi> therein <hi>contained not onely</hi> Moſes, <hi>but a</hi> greater <hi>than</hi> Moſes; <hi>ſo far were you from being</hi> deceived. <hi>But tell me if you have</hi> yet <hi>ſeen your Friend?</hi> Theſe laſt words made him as <hi>ſad</hi> as the other made him <hi>joyful. I think,</hi> anſwered he, weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very ſadly, <hi>I ſaw him once, but ſo alter'd and chang'd, as I ſcarce knew him; and then he would not come near me, but ran away, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince can I hear of him: this is now the</hi> thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth <hi>month in which I have not ſpake unto him. I have at last got</hi> Parthenius <hi>to travel along with me; and he alſo is</hi> ſeeking <hi>for one that is</hi> loſt.</p>
                     <p>The charitably-minded <hi>Theoſophus</hi> gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to both, how they ſhould bring them back, if they lighted at any time into their company: and told them, that perhaps they might find them either <hi>blind</hi> or <hi>deaf,</hi> but that under the cover of friendſhip they might <hi>apply</hi> that which, with the divine bleſſing, would <hi>cure</hi> both their <hi>Eyes</hi> and <hi>Ears.</hi> So he parted from them, holding up his hands, and ſaying,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:61162:63"/> 
                        <hi>God</hi> bleſs <hi>you, brave Youths, and give you your deſired</hi> ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>When they were gone he read over again <hi>Eubulus</hi> his Letter, it being ſo unexpected and ſo ſurprizing to him, and thought upon it with much concern for his three <hi>Friends,</hi> but little for <hi>himſelf.</hi> Scarce had he read it, when he heard a tumultuous noiſe, which as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched ſtill nearer, he diſtinguiſhed to be, <hi>Where is this heretical Dog? did we not ſee him here?</hi> And inſtantly he was ſurrounded by the rude Country-folk (that he had <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 3.</note> lately left) arm'd with Fails, Forks, and other ruſtick Weapons that came next to hand. Amongſt whom he ſaw a young man not like the reſt, of more ingenuous looks, which he thought to have <hi>ſome</hi> reſemblance of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> and <hi>more</hi> of the old loyal <hi>Hegemon</hi> whom he loved. But as they were laying their barbarous clutches upon his aged body, as if they meant to tear and ſhake him limb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meal apieces; there fell a very great Storm of Hail and Rain that diſperſed them all, and forced them (againſt their wills) to leave him unto his eſcape. Whereupon his <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> broke out into Songs of <hi>deliverance,</hi> and his pious Soul confeſſed that ſo <hi>unexpected</hi> an Evaſion, and ſo <hi>miraculous,</hi> could not but be the effect of his <hi>all-powerful</hi> Preſerver.</p>
                     <p>But the devout Father had never long time
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61162:63"/> to rejoyce: he was ſoon after ſet upon again by ſome others of a contrary Faction and courſe of Life, Tories bravely mounted, (with whom was <hi>Santomero</hi> in diſguiſe) who in a drolling manner thus accoſted him: <hi>Prithee, old Grandſire, canst tell us any news of our friend</hi> Theoſophus? <hi>Sirs</hi> (replied he) <hi>you cannot eaſily miſs of him.</hi> So ſpurring their Horſes, they <hi>left</hi> him whom they moſt <hi>ſought</hi> after, and rode in <hi>queſt</hi> of him whom they had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>found.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again another time, on a dark Moonleſs night, as he was repaired to a melancholy and ſecret Wood for his Devotions, he lighted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was aware, upon a private <hi>Junto</hi> of men, who all riſing up to him, ſurprized him with this Complement: <hi>O Father</hi> Mariana, <hi>are you come? Our Aſſociates</hi> Pedro <hi>and</hi> Loyola <hi>bad us at your arrival expect to receive the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of our ſupreme</hi> Mufty, <hi>and gave us ſtrict charge to follow your Advice.</hi> Theſe words ſtarted him not a little, you may be ſure; and had he not been opportunely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended by the night, his <hi>looks</hi> would without doubt have manifeſted the <hi>Error.</hi> But finding that he was took for a quite different perſon, he thought it the ſafeſt courſe not to diſcloſe who <hi>really</hi> he was. Aſſuming therefore cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage from the diſguiſe of a falſe <hi>Mariana,</hi> he paſt confidently by, and with a ſeeming great
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:61162:64"/> haſte, thus abruptly beſpoke them: <hi>Stay me not now with your diſcourſe, for my buſineſs is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent upon me, and will not admit of any the</hi> leaſt <hi>delay.</hi> To which they all as quick replied, <hi>Whither hie you ſo faſt? Is it to aſſaſſinate the Tyrant</hi> Baſilius? <hi>Well, after your work is finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pray fail not to meet us at</hi> Bethaven, <hi>where we long to hear you relate the Tranſactions of St.</hi> Peter's <hi>Court. Nor will we our ſelves be lacking to entertain you with a ſatisfactory account of the ſtrange ſucceſs our Stratagems have hitherto had againſt that religious heretical Sot</hi> Theoſophus <hi>and his</hi> Adherents. <hi>So farewel: Let Hell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper your deſignes.</hi> The moſt <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Theoſophus</hi> not much regarding their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, or wicked Plottings, made haſte away; glad to be ſo eaſily rid of his <hi>deceived</hi> Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, and with but <hi>ſmall</hi> intent to <hi>meet</hi> them at the appointed place. Although the <hi>name</hi> and <hi>practices</hi> of <hi>Mariana</hi> were notoriouſly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough <hi>infamous,</hi> yet this honeſt Eremite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now could never be induced to believe him an <hi>Accomplice</hi> of them, who in publick ſtrove to appear his moſt inveterate and jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <hi>Enemies.</hi> So horrid a confederacy and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity betwixt two ſuch ſeeming oppoſite Parties, was too ſtrong for his Faith, and made him now almoſt miſtruſt his Senſes. Having got free from <hi>them,</hi> he ſpent the whole night in Prayers for <hi>Baſilius,</hi> and that (once <hi>flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)</hi>
                        <pb n="115" facs="tcp:61162:64"/> Church which their <hi>helliſh</hi> Complottings had <hi>ſubverted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He was afterwards encountered by ſeveral other Companies. And though he came not off always free from violence, yet ſtill found deliverance; a <hi>ſure,</hi> if not an <hi>eaſie</hi> one. Which Encounters, for that they were many, and the remembrance of them might perhaps prove <hi>troubleſome</hi> to a few good men, are wholly omitted.</p>
                     <p>Thus being purſued by <hi>all</hi> Parties, and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes</hi> hardly eſcaping with life, he wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many a weary ſtep through over-grown Woods and dark ſolitary Receſſes, abſconding himſelf in Caves and Grotto's, till at laſt he ſettled in a poor Hut, that for <hi>ſecreſie</hi> and the <hi>nearneſs</hi> of a certain Oratory, commended it ſelf before all others. It was indeed not much indebted to <hi>Art,</hi> but rarely well accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all natural Conveniencies for a <hi>recluſe</hi> life; and being immur'd in by the green and prickly cloſure of a kind Thicket, was almoſt render'd ſecure from the violence of wild Beaſts, and the queſt of humane Malice; as if it had been purpoſely deſigned at firſt by the careful induſtry of Providence, a Sanctuary in future times to ſome perſecuted religious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorite.

                     <p>AT this the charitable Father, almoſt ſtruck like him, believing that his Spirit then had quite vaniſhed, and that now nothing in him of life was any longer remaining; fell down with him to the ground. Such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate lifeleſs ſtupor had indeed benumm'd the poor wretches Soul, that although the touch and preſſure of a Prophet has proved <hi>vital</hi> and <hi>ſalutary</hi> to more than one, and the embraces and the expanſion of a man of God <hi>reviving</hi> to many a <hi>dead</hi> Sinner, yet could this produce no effect upon the <hi>appearing</hi> Corpſe.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon, after the Father had a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf, and was able, he went to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a Grave. When as he was going, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his <hi>Viſion,</hi> Promiſes of his God, and late apparition of an enliven'd Carcaſs, ſoon called him back, and bad him not diſtruſt the <hi>Veracity</hi> of him that could not <hi>lye.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Being therefore come home into the hole of his devout Hermitage, and having laid down his ſad burthen, and wept over it; he made a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61162:67"/> 
                        <hi>gentle</hi> Fire (for it is near an impoſſibility to do any good in this caſe, if the Fires of Zeal be either <hi>extinct</hi> or over-<hi>vehement)</hi> to expel the cold and noxious Vapours. To it he brought the ſenſeleſs body, in which he knew the Soul was <hi>buried;</hi> and left not off applying ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocatives</hi> as he had always at hand, till he felt <hi>warmth</hi> therein, next <hi>breath:</hi> And at laſt came a deep <hi>ſigh, (a glad</hi> note you will ſay however of life) which was followed by this ſhort moan, O <hi>Eubulus, Eubulus!</hi>—But here he ſtopt, not able to go further. This ſo filled the ſpirits of <hi>Theoſophus</hi> with <hi>joy,</hi> that (as his cuſtom was) he could not forbear running out into Hymns of Praiſe and thankful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments. Beſides, it pleaſed him much to hear <hi>Eubulus</hi> named above any other; as either longing perhaps to hear ſome news of his long-abſent Friend, or elſe not knowing the true cauſe, willing to attribute it to a <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural</hi> Impulſe; and even reckon the very calling and ſeeking after that reverend <hi>Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> of Souls, ſome kind of preſage of <hi>Recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Now marking the lines of his face, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected how that amongſt the tumultuous Ruſticks in their late Aſſault, he had obſerved his forward <hi>fury,</hi> and had often liſtened to the Character given him by this ſame worthy perſon, whom returning to himſelf, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently called for. All which made him not
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:61162:67"/> deſiſt his labour, until with continual chafing and rubbing, he brought him wholly to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf again.</p>
                     <p>But he obſerves his Patient, in whoſe pale languid face but juſt afore there ſhone the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of ſuch feminine ſweetneſs and winning prettineſs, to be now covered over with Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and Plague-ſores, with the cruſt of a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie, and the ruptures of Violence, ſcorched up with burning Fevers, and the Calenture of an intemperate Diet: tortur'd with ſharp Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, with grievous twingings of Conſcience; ſo that he looked upon him as the moſt defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and the moſt loathſome Monſter in the whole Univerſe, the moſt miſerable Wretch, vile unhappy Caitive, that ever his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. Yet even this <hi>increaſed</hi> (not <hi>leſſened)</hi> his <hi>care</hi> and <hi>hopes.</hi> For the <hi>breaking</hi> out and the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> he took to be the firſt and moſt neceſſary ſtep towards its <hi>Cure,</hi> and the <hi>ſureſt</hi> prognoſtick of <hi>mending.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It would have <hi>daunted</hi> I believe the moſt <hi>daring</hi> Sinner, have <hi>ſtopt</hi> him in his full <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere,</hi> but to have beheld here the <hi>foulneſs</hi> of Vice <hi>unmaskt;</hi> whoſe ghaſtly affrighting looks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all their <hi>adventitious</hi> beauty and falſe <hi>glozing</hi> pleaſures, needed no Eloquence to <hi>paint</hi> them <hi>worſe.</hi> Whilſt his Breaſt (O all ye who read theſe Papers) was ranſacked by this Ghoſtly Father, there appeared ſuch <hi>ſtrange</hi>
                        <pb n="122" facs="tcp:61162:68"/> forms of Evils, and ſo <hi>numerous,</hi> making it the place of their beaſtly <hi>Revels</hi> and licentious <hi>Scuffles,</hi> as muſt needs certainly have ſtruck <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror</hi> and awful <hi>confuſion</hi> (if not repentance) into the <hi>careleſs</hi> worldly-minded man: yea, made the <hi>boldeſt</hi> and <hi>atheiſtical</hi> Champion of Hell <hi>quake</hi> with cold ſhiverings. The <hi>Doemoniack</hi> (ſo I think I may call him) was <hi>poſſeſt</hi> by no leſs than a whole <hi>Legion</hi> of Infernal <hi>Elves;</hi> who were diſcern'd <hi>then</hi> in thick ſwarms crawling about his <hi>wicked</hi> heart, that moſt <hi>foul</hi> Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of all manner of <hi>Impurity, ſcarified</hi> with Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertiniſm, and even <hi>burnt</hi> into aſhes with Luſt and Youthful Deſires.</p>
                     <p>His Gall had likewiſe overflown all the reſt of his <hi>better</hi> parts, and fill'd his Spirit with <hi>bitterneſs.</hi> His vital <hi>heat</hi> was in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extinguiſhed by thoſe black putrid <hi>humours</hi> which <hi>rotted</hi> his entrails, and made them <hi>ſwell</hi> into ſuch a vaſt <hi>hydropick</hi> bigneſs.

Thus his Reaſon was <hi>diſturb'd,</hi> and Life <hi>endanger'd.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Near his Liver lay a Bag of rank greeniſh Poyſon that diſcharged it ſelf through all the

So that every Member was corrupted, all the powers of his Soul ſick and weakened, lamed or dead, <hi>common</hi> Senſe exil'd, and his <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> Senſes made the Caterers for Vice: his Ears tinkled after obſcene and goatiſh Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; his Eyes (like two baleful Torches ſet on fire with Hell) ſtill caſt forth nought but impure and luſtful Flames; his Palate was vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated with <hi>Aſian</hi> Luxury; his Hand with Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceny and Fraud; his Head and Brains were giddy; his Limbs ſeiz'd with Rottonneſs; and his Tongue whet with Adders venome.</p>
                     <p>Good God, how was the Father ſurprized to behold this Monſter of Iniquity, and Sink of all Uncleanneſs! How was he appal'd with horrour at the diſſection of this ſo guilty and leprous a Soul, polluted and ſtain'd with ſo many defilements, depraved with ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of Turpitude, and ſlurred after ſuch a groſs manner with the fouleſt and deadlieſt Impieties! But how glad was he to diſcover and <hi>ſcent</hi> thoſe wilde beſtial Luſts kennel'd in their proper Dens and lurking Holes! Thus the prudent and holy Confeſſor, by prying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſource and the cauſes of the Malady, he (like a wiſe Phyſician of the Body) learnt to drive it out the better by a due application of medicinal and effectual means.</p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:61162:69"/>
                     <p>And how alſo did the Wretch himſelf look! Now the ſcales fell from his Eyes, &amp; Vice appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him in its ugly terrifying Aſpect: All the ſweets and the pleaſures of his former lewd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions vaniſhed, and nothing but the Sting was left behind: Now nothing ſeem'd to be more ridiculouſly odious than an Habit of Sinning: Now did thoſe precious Hours which he had ſaunter'd away in wanton Dalliance, return to accuſe him: His divine and noble Soul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braided his Sloath and Negligence; and the beauty of Virtue was ſo raviſhing in his eyes, as to make him eſteem himſelf the blindeſt fool in nature, who had never yet courted <hi>her,</hi> or not courted her for <hi>her ſelf:</hi> Now was he heartily ſorry that ever he had offended the ſupream Majeſty of Heaven, and would not in barter for the whole World, conſent to act over afreſh thoſe ſins which might provoke <hi>him</hi> to anger.</p>
                     <p>He now confeſt Drunkenneſs to be a <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned</hi> Potion, Senſuality and Intemperance to be but <hi>Swiniſh</hi> Delights and the very <hi>baits</hi> of Perdition, Prodigality to be a toyiſh idle <hi>Freak,</hi> and Arrogance a ſwelling <hi>Tumor</hi> of the Mind, Profaneneſs a bold extravagant <hi>Phrenſie,</hi> and all his paſt courſe of life <hi>Madneſs</hi> and <hi>Folly.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Eſteeming theſe no ordinary Marks of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Health, the good Phyſician was ſtill eager in continuing his help. He admoniſhed his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61162:69"/> Patient to purge his Soul of that naſtineſs and filth in which ſhe was bemir'd; to exorciſe thoſe Imps of Hell that were (he ſaw) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly effecting his ruine, by ſincere and holy Grief; and to cleanſe his Ulcers with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitental Tears, thoſe waters which are far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than <note n="*" place="margin">2 King. 5. 12.</note>

                     <p>At this a violent paſſion ſeiz'd his heart, and made his eyes guſh out into flouds of Tears. Which prepared him to utter with devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and humility this pious antient Solilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy, <hi>viz. Put me not to rebuke, O Lord—: There is no health in my fleſh—, neither is there any reſt in my bones, by reaſon of my ſin—: My wounds ſtink and are corrupt through my fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—: My loins are fill'd with a ſore diſeaſe, and there is no ſoundneſs in my fleſh. I am fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſore broken—: I roar therefore for the very diſquietneſs of my heart: my heart panteth, my ſtrength faileth me, and the light of my eyes is gone from me.—And I truly am ſet in the plague,</hi>—Pſal. 28.</p>
                     <p>In this moanful Ditty (which was ſtill now and then interrupted with grievous fighs and throbs) he went on lamenting the foulneſs of his Diſeaſe, and ſolliciting with great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the comfortable ſuccour and <hi>healing Touch</hi>
                        <pb n="126" facs="tcp:61162:70"/> of his merciful Redeemer: that <hi>Touch</hi> which was alone able to cure the <hi>Lunacy</hi> of a diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd brain, the <hi>complicated</hi> ills of an obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Spirit, and regenerate his Mind anew by <hi>unlodging</hi> thoſe helliſh Furies that <hi>neſted</hi> within his breaſt. Having uſed this and ſome other ſelect forms, he concluded all in the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Comprizal of devout ſorrow, <hi>Have mercy upon me</hi>—Pſal. 51. to the end.</p>
                     <p>After he had lain a good while in this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and penitent poſture, his looks began to be chearful, his paleneſs to be ting'd with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle red, his deformities grew leſs, and his ſores dryed up into ſcurf. <hi>Theoſophus,</hi> who by theſe glad ſignes was aſcertained that his inward parts were now thorowly rinced and gargled by thoſe <hi>purgative</hi> Doſes he had afore given him, thinks time to anoint his <hi>Sores</hi> with a certain generous <hi>Balſam.</hi> Some call it <hi>Balm</hi> of <hi>Gilead,</hi> others the <hi>Panarion</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> but all know it to be the <hi>Bloud</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and that nothing elſe can cure a broken wounded Soul; nor <hi>even</hi> that, if the Wounds be not firſt made <hi>clean</hi> (for elſe how can it <hi>operate?)</hi> by the <hi>drops</hi> of a <hi>preparatory</hi> Contrition. He bad his Patient rely upon the Mercies of God, and the ſaving Name of JESUS; and having diſcourſed to him about an hour, of the nature and the effects of <hi>Repentance,</hi> (which will be too long to inſert here) concluding with ſome

                     <p>When not long after, having inveſted himſelf in an holy (but penitential) dreſs, he was led by his reverend Guide to a very fair and beautiful Temple not far off, in the midſt of a gloomy religious Wood, commodiouſly enough ſeated for the devout retirement of the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted Followers of JESUS.

Why ſhould God the Son, whom I had ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt, bear the load and puniſhment of that ſin?

Who can believe there is ſo great Charity for an Enemy, or ſuch Honours as theſe
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:61162:78"/> for the vileſt of the children of men? This was indeed too great for me to expect or wiſh for; will take up all the wonder of Men and Angels—Ah! have have not my Crimes crucified him, my Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions made him bleed; and could he yet do and ſuffer ſo much for me? Has not my Pride, alas, ſtript him naked, my Intemperance and Luxury forced him to fast? And did not my Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs make him poor, my Ambition a ſlave?

                     <p>JUſt then as they were ſpeaking, they thought they heard a clacking at the outer wicket of the Lodge: And as ſoon as it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, who ſhould they find waiting there, but this very ſame <hi>Eubulus;</hi> whom their joy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently introduced? Which joy was ſo great, that a good while was ſpent in profound ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing on each other, in mutual Embraces, and in all the Arts of <hi>ſilent</hi> endearments; afore they knew how to expreſs it in words, or wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (any otherwiſe) their long-expected Stranger.</p>
                     <p>The firſt who broke ſilence was the young Penitent: <q rend="margQuotes">Pray tell me (ſaid he) my dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Monitor, how you came this day to leave us; tell me, good <hi>Eubulus,</hi> why we parted ſo abrupty at the Temple. I was e'en afraid you had forgot me. You ſee, my dear Son (ſaid <hi>Eubulus)</hi> that for your ſake I am returned again ſo ſoon: nor could I in truth be any longer abſent from you, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I knew you <hi>here</hi> to be ſafe enough; yea, as well as my heart could wiſh you.
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61162:88"/> My rejoycing was almoſt unutterable, to find you to day in ſo holy a place and poſture as I did: and much more to find you (poin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at <hi>Theoſophus)</hi> with this Reverend men. But pardon me if I could not tarry then to ſpeak unto you, through fear of ſuch Irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities as might perchance have happened, had I left the care of thoſe poor Pilgrims I conducted thither. Whence I carried them ſtrait to a Shepherds Cottage hard by, who is called <hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The Youth could not here forbear from embracing him again, and telling him how much he longed to be on this Journey to the Holy Land. And as the two aged Fathers were diſcourſing about their great Concerns, he could think of nothing but his Journey, and the miraculouſneſs of his recovery from the Grave. All within him was <hi>tranſport</hi> of Joy and Gladneſs, and in the very midſt of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe he would ſay unto himſelf, <hi>Rejoyce therefore, O my Soul, and praiſe thy Lord, who has at laſt brought thee back unto himſelf. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with me, ye glorious Spirits who attend his Throne, being always ready to congratulate the recovery of a dying Soul; and all ye who have</hi>

                        <hi>left the World and put on Palmers Weeds, that there is one more added to your number. I have received the Calice of Salvation, and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be glad: My Soul ſhall always praiſe the Lord.</hi> And then he would ſtart, and ſpeak a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to his Friends, and then ſpeak inwardly to himſelf, <hi>But what made thee to be ſo kind to me, holy</hi> Jeſu? <hi>What have I ever done to merit thus thy favour? Couldeſt thou ſee any thing worthy of thee, in a</hi> leprous <hi>Soul</hi> ſpotted <hi>with thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable</hi> Stains <hi>and</hi> Defilements? Thus was he fixed upon Heaven, and thus converſed with the place of his <hi>Deſire:</hi> whereas none can conceive the pleaſure of his thoughts, but thoſe good Souls who have at any time felt the like, and are not altogether unacquainted with Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial Raviſhments. Then preſently he took <hi>Eubulus,</hi> and with all the expreſſions of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude imaginable, related unto him aſide, what great things the good and wiſe <hi>Theoſophus</hi> had done for his Soul, the ſeveral paſſages of his Sickneſs, and the whole courſe of its Cure. He now divided his Joy with his Grief, ſo as not one ſhould leſſen the other, and ſo as you could not gueſs which was the <hi>greateſt;</hi> while he told him of the many <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of his <hi>Sin-ſick</hi> Soul, and the <hi>Infernal</hi> Troops that had <hi>haun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> him, and <hi>cohabited</hi> with him, and how mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly he was reſcued from their <hi>Tyranny;</hi> aggravating the <hi>foulneſs</hi> of his Crimes, and the

                        <hi>baſeneſs</hi> of his Apoſtacy, and extolling as high as he was able the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of his Redeemer.

                     <p>When <hi>Theoſophus,</hi> the Sun being about ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, called them to ſit down to a frugal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

For they (good Souls) who thought themſelves bound at <hi>all</hi> times, and for <hi>all</hi> things, to pay <hi>Him</hi> tributary Thanks, could not at <hi>this</hi> time, and for ſo <hi>many</hi> things, forbear from turning their <hi>Congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of <hi>each other,</hi> into <hi>Adorations</hi> of <hi>Him.</hi>

                        <hi>Father, how is thy Name profaned, thy Truth ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thy Temples polluted! how are we driven up and down like Sheep without a Shepherd! Though we are the Sheep of thy Hand, and part of thy Poſſeſſion, yet are we ſcattered. Why do the People rage, and imagine thus a vain thing againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt? Behold, O Lord, and have mercy: O let not the Gates of Hell prevail againſt thy Church. Thou haſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that they ſhall not prevail. Be merciful, be merciful, for thy Names ſake have mercy on us; leſt we faint and die in this Wilderneſs, and enter not into the Land of thy Promiſes, into the Regions of Peace and Charity, there to be bleſſed to all eternity with the fruition of thy Glory. Do thou, O God, who art the Author of Peace, and the Lover of Concord, in knowledge of whom ſtandeth our eternal Life, whoſe ſervice is perfect freedom, the moſt abſolute liberty; defend us thy humble Servants, thy poor Pilgrims, from all the Aſſaults either open or ſecret, from within us or without us, of our and thine Enemies, that we ſurely tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in thy Defence, may not fear the Power of any Adverſaries Spiritual or Temporal, through the Might of Jeſus Chriſt the Prince of Peace, our Lord and our Protector.</hi> Amen.</p>

                     <p>I was born on that happy day wherein all Hearts were glad to ſee the great <hi>Baſilius</hi> aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend his Fathers Throne; and was ſoon after ſolemnly initiated, by Proxies, into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith. Ever ſince I have worn the Badge thereof, and am called <hi>TIMOTHE<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S;</hi> for at the ſacred Font I received that Name: there the holy man took me into his arms and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me. During my Infancy it was very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to judge which way my natural Bent did encline me. Yet there were ſome, who (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps to flatter my Parents) would often praiſe my childiſh looks and geſtures, and ſeem to read my future Deſtiny in the Cradle. As ſoon as ever I could prattle and talk, my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did her endeavour to infuſe into me the Principles of Religion, and by winning Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to betray me to my Duty. And being afterwards continually under the inſpection of a Father and a Tutor, I behaved my ſelf ſo as not to miſs of their Applauſe; nor could my
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:61162:96"/> Nature (being ſo reſtrained) in all this while break out: till at laſt I was ſent to an Uncle, who inhabits the further part of this Iſland, to avoid the Infection of the Town which increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed dayly. Who received me with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Joy, taking truly, whilſt I tarried with him, no leſs care of me than of his own Son. At his Houſe I became acquainted with an excellent perſon, one <hi>Theophilus,</hi> whom I remember that laſt night both you and <hi>Eubu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> ſpake concerning; a Youth indeed of ſuch noble Qualities and heroick Virtues, which made him attract the hearts of all who ever beheld him. I for my part was raviſhed with the native ſweetneſs of his Temper, and found no delight except in his company; whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I made my Friend and Partner of my Breaſt. But alas! after ſome few months, I received the fatal Meſſage of my Mothers death, and of my Fathers taking to the Wars.</p>
                     <p>It was a good while before I could recover of that Grief, with which I was ſeized by ſo unwelcome News. But I was no ſooner come to my ſelf, when out of a mad humourſome Frolick, I reſolved to forſake my deareſt Friends, and amongſt them the good <hi>Theophilus</hi> alſo, who hath ever ſince, it ſeems, been ſeeking me.

Where to ſee the flocking of Courtiers about a Stranger, made me welnigh run beſide my Wits. <hi>Some</hi> accoſted me with many ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Salutations, interfering pretty faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oaths and modiſh Curſes with their words: <hi>Others</hi> demanded what News from the Camp, and what both Armies intended to do that Summer; and one of a more comical humour than any of the reſt, very gravely delivering himſelf in <hi>Redouts, Mantelets, Courtines, Pali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſades,</hi> and a thouſand other as lofty Bantrums, would needs read to me a Lecture of the Art of War: Another ſort would ſeem to pry deepeſt in all the <hi>Machivellian</hi> Artifices, and <hi>Muſcovitiſh</hi> Frauds of crafty States-men; delighting to diſcourſe of the Intrigues of foreign Courts.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61162:98"/> Their immodeſt Pranks and filthy Pleaſures, their laſcivious Glances, their Dreſſes, their Motions, Gellies, paſſionate and languiſhing Speeches, had ſo much of the Devil in them, and ſo much of fooliſh Sin, and frantick Vice, that you I believe would have taken it for the very <hi>Bedlam</hi> of Hell. There ſate an old decrepit dothing Lover, writhen-faced and bald-pated, toothleſs and blear-eyed, wantonly flickering over a young Girl: and there an old deformed Crone that could neither ſee nor hear, ſet off with her Pencil and Alembick-waters, caterwauling after a luſty Youth.

The Devil that ſeized a Chriſtian at theſe Sights, being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the Exorciſt wherefore he durſt do <hi>this,</hi> anſwered, it was his own Ground, and he did nothing but what was right.</q> Whether <hi>his</hi> Plea be <hi>now</hi> juſt the ſame as it was <hi>then,</hi> I cannot tell; but the Hiſtory I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid is too dayly verified in the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that frequent that place. It may be the effeminate Gallants of our Age, who by the burnings of Luſt love to antedate their Hell, ſcarce count this a Puniſhment, and are ready almoſt to think the Devil good company that can be where ſuch Mirth is. Indeed the Primitive Inſtitution of the Stage was to <hi>correct</hi> Vice: now into what a World are we

                     <p>Then <hi>Timotheus</hi> went on again: After this the Ladies had me to a Ball. When I know not by what chance, looking but up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, there fell a drop of Gall (I think it was) into mine eyes, which made them ſee clearer, and diſcern it to be the ghaſtly <hi>Reveiles</hi> of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure <hi>Satyrs</hi> and womaniſh <hi>Devils.</hi> But ſuch <hi>Witchcraft</hi> was in their eyes, that by but <hi>looking</hi> on them I my ſelf was <hi>transform'd</hi> into one of them, and now took them for <hi>Angels.</hi> For here I firſt ſaw, and then admired, my <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi>

                     <p>One day as we were in the midſt of our wild Jollity, we heard a noiſe and hurry in the Street. Every one went to ſee what was the matter; ſo that I was left alone. I was not long ſo; for no ſooner were they gone, but in ſteps that ſame venerable perſon, who would have hindred my firſt ingreſs into this Road. Who coming to me before I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, thus ſpake to me with Tears: <q rend="margQuotes">What have I caught you here, young man?</q> At this I was ſo abaſh'd as not to know what to anſwer. <q rend="margQuotes">Well, (continued he) are you now convinced of that I told you? What Reſt or Pleaſure do you think to find in this place, which it ſeems you have choſen out for your Quarters? Alas, if you do, you are quite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived: much eaſier are they to be found in humble Cottages and Cells, in the poor Retreats of contented Pilgrims. For all theſe, whom perhaps you admire and envy for their Happineſs, are indeed the moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Wretches that you can phancy to your ſelf.</q> What, theſe men miſerable (ſaid I) who are thus attended and waited upon, who feaſt ſplendidly, and ſee no days of ſorrow or melancholy? No, no, you ſhall not delude me out of my Senſes. Tell me not any more of Miſery in this Jovial and Sportſome Company,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61162:102"/> in ſuch Feaſtings as theſe, and the Pomps and honourable Retinue of this Great Man, the Riches of another, and the illuſtrious Name of a third.

They hold great Ranks, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs in the World, and boaſt much their Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree; but who knows whether that Page who was caught ſo often ſmiling upon his Lady, or another truſted Servant, or that Gentleman-Uſher who uſed to ſteal into her Chamber, or that Phyſician whoſe frequent Viſits were ſo welcome, be not the Father of the Child? Or elſe perhaps the Mother (and ſo it has been known) proſtituted her Bodie to a Groom of the Stable, or let a Coachman who was privie to all her wanton Rambles, himſelf ſatisfie her Luſt? You admire the Riches and the Happineſs of yonder man, his Gold, his Silver, Jewels, Tapiſtry, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificent abundance of every thing. Why,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:61162:102"/> what of all this? Is he any thing the happier for theſe precious Superfluities? Look you but upon them, and you have then quite as much of them as he; are altogether as rich and happy as the Poſſeſſor himſelf. Do the bags of Money hoarded in your Coffers do you any more good than if they were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to the Mines again, or drowned in the bottom of the Sea? Doth the Owner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them any more than any other; nay, than the poor Beggar at the door begging an Alms? And wherefore have Nobles ſo many ſtately Palaces? If they inhabit them not, they may with as <hi>good</hi> (nay <hi>better)</hi> reaſon be ſaid to be the Palaces of Mice, or the rich Manſions of Spiders and deſpiſed Vermin.

Pray, Son, be not angry with me for being ſo free with you; for I know not how to flatter you with Lyes; and by this Habit which I wear, I am obliged to tell you the Truth.

How much nobler, I pray, is <hi>Sloth</hi> than the <hi>Scurvie;</hi> and what is your <hi>Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liking</hi> but the <hi>Megrim</hi> of a dizzie Brain?

He is as daring and preſumptuous a Sinner, I believe, as ever travelled herein, a moſt profligate Wretch that has tried all the ways of lewd Delight, and left nothing of Wickedneſs uneſſayed. Yet with great ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs he once confeſſed, that in no act of Sin he ever took ſuch pleaſure, as was able to <hi>counterpoiſe</hi> the ſorrow he afterwards felt: that he never committed what is ſinful, but that as ſoon almoſt he wiſhed it never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: nor ever trod one ſtep <hi>further,</hi> but that he repented he had gone ſo <hi>far.</hi> He told me alſo what ghaſtly frighting thoughts
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:61162:103"/> he had when he was alone; what uneaſineſs he had within him, and what trouble and perplexity he hath all along met with in his Travels. But (which is almoſt paſt belief) he is ſo bewitched, that ſtill he fooliſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to run on in this lamentable courſe: he ſtill as wilfully as ever perſiſts in his Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and cannot be perſwaded ſo much as to ſtep one ſtep backwards. Pray, conſider what I ſay, before it be too late; for all this but a ſhort melancholy Fit made him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge unto me. Depart therefore hence; hereafter poſſibly you may tell me the ſame as he. By thoſe <hi>paſt</hi> good Deeds which elſe will be forgotten, by that Duty which you own unto your <hi>Parents,</hi> by that Love which once you <hi>did</hi> (or at leaſt <hi>profeſt</hi> to) bear unto <hi>Theophilus,</hi> yea by that Love you bear unto <hi>your ſelf;</hi> I entreat and adjure you to return with me, to return back into the Path of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>everlaſting</hi> Rewards: You are elſe, to all Eternity, <hi>undone.</hi>

                     <p>Wherefore to omit all that, I being at laſt quite tired with this kind of life, reſolved one way or another to break out of this ſtately Priſon. (For that which at firſt I took for a <hi>Palace,</hi> I found to be a <hi>Gaol.)</hi> So having one

Whereof there is a Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption between two and three thouſand years old; which I need but to uſe, it being ſo exactly fitted thereto, by not onely the Wiſeſt of Men, and moſt underſtanding Obſervator of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, but one who had ſtrayed with me in this very Way, and had experience e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, no man I believe will deny, as having <note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 11. 1, 2, 3.</note> out of his own and all the bordering Nations, no leſs than ſeven hundred Wives Princeſſes, and three hundred Concubines at his Will.</p>

Come, ſaid ſhe, let us take our fill of Love until the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, let us ſolace our ſelves with Loves. With much fair Speech ſhe cauſed me to yield, with the flattering of her Lips ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me.

                     <p>I was ſurprized to meet with here thoſe very ſame men that I had left behind me at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; who after they had chid me for ſo lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them, told me however they were very glad to find me where they did.

This he did, and many other abſurd fantaſtick Pranks, as ridiculous and expenſive, to gain the Applauſe of the By-ſtanders. The Shouts and merry Ecchoes of the buſie Applauders, and their Peals of loud Laughter had for a pretty while rung in his ears. He had now emptied ſince I came ſeveral large Coffers in a trice; and to complete his brave Extravagancy, he takes out of a ſmall iron Cheſt what was left of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, a bundle of Deeds.

<pb n="200" facs="tcp:61162:107"/> Monitor caught hold on me, and ſaid, You ſhall preſently ſee all the Hags in Hell light their Torches at that Wretches face. But I could not now bear the company or the words of ſo reverend a man, and therefore thruſt him from me; who departed holding up his hands and praying, I gueſs, for my Converſion. But, according as he ſaid, the mad Bedlam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wretch was inſtantly all in a flame, as if indeed he was preparing to be the <hi>Fuel</hi> of Hell, and all the <hi>Vices</hi> and the <hi>Paſſions</hi> were <hi>lighted</hi> at his helliſh <hi>fiery</hi> Countenance.

                     <p>You may perhaps have heard of one ſo ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculouſly revengeful, as neither to eat nor to drink, if he whom he envies but lives on bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; this was that very perſon: He, like the <hi>Cantharides,</hi> delighted to <hi>feaſt</hi> on others <hi>Sores,</hi> and was never <hi>merry</hi> but at others <hi>Sadneſſes:</hi> He had much rather ſee himſelf in <hi>Miſery,</hi> than his Neighbour in <hi>Proſperity;</hi> and to go to <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet</hi> alone, than with company to the <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of the Bleſſed.

                     <p>And ſo I gueſſed right. For running away from him, as being afraid of ſo ſcraggie and miſchievous a Fellow, I fell upon a lubberly unthinking Lurdan hard by, ſtretcht out (juſt as I have ſeen him expreſſed by the Painters fancy in his <hi>Poetick</hi> Regions of <hi>Crapulia,</hi> or the much-fam'd <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Lazy)</hi> under a Tree, from whoſe laden boughs dropped fair Fruit into his mouth; whilſt ſeven beautiful Dam'ſels were ready with Bowls of ſpiced Wines to quench his coſtly Thirſt. I cannot tell whether I was infected by him I laſt met, or whether it was from my natural averſion to Sloth (the <hi>uglieſt</hi> in my mind of all the deadly ſins) that could not forbear repining at his Happineſs: (For Happineſs, alas, I thought it.) But the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which looked ſo freſh, I ſoon ſaw to be
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:61162:108"/> the Apples of <hi>Sodom,</hi> Rottenneſs and Aſhes; the Grapes, ſuch as diſcovered our Father <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s nakedneſs; and the Wine whereof he drank, the Wine of Iniquity, and of eternal Vengeance. Now the Dam'ſels which mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred the ſame unto him, delighted to <hi>prick</hi> him with Thorns, and ſo make him <hi>ſhrug;</hi> and then, pulling off their Vizors, with their gaſtly looks forced him to leap down into a fathomleſs Deep. After which he was never ſeen more. Whereat, ſore affrighten'd, I left, with great horrour, this ſad Spectacle of Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Sloth, and of the hurtful Dalliance of a wanton Fortune that is attended on by all the deadly ſins, thoſe <hi>ſeven</hi> flattering <hi>Furies</hi> in <hi>who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh</hi> diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>But this ſtopped me not in my Journey, but I rather went on the faſter for it. For having all ſorts of Company to divert my ſelf in, ſuch an Accident as this could not <hi>long</hi> trouble me. On <hi>this</hi> ſide of me paſſed the Raſh and Fool-hardy, and would fain ſeem va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant; but that every one judged him fitter to rave in an Hoſpital of mad men, than in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other place: his Brain was <hi>hot.</hi> On the <hi>other</hi> ſide of me paſſed one whoſe Bloud was thick and muddy, and his Brain <hi>frozen;</hi> and he would ſeem, forſooth, to be <hi>wary;</hi> but his Mind was <hi>really</hi> perplexed with Fears and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets, whence he would ſtartle if a Mouſe did
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:61162:108"/> but ſtir, or a Flye buz in his ear; be frighten'd out of his little wits at Armies under ground: He was laughed at by every one, and called <hi>Poltron</hi> and Daſtard. In another File marched the fond <hi>Cockering</hi> Mothers, and the <hi>cruel</hi> Step-dames; they with <hi>Kindneſs,</hi> theſe with <hi>
                           <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkindneſs,</hi> both alike deſtroying their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: Then the <hi>Buſie-bodies</hi> and the <hi>Idle</hi> both together; for both had equally <hi>nothing</hi> to do: <hi>There</hi> Sir <hi>Formal,</hi> and <hi>here</hi> Squire <hi>Freak,</hi> waited on by <hi>Petulance</hi> and <hi>Levity:</hi> A nice <hi>dapper</hi> Fellow on <hi>that</hi> ſide; a dirty <hi>Slouch</hi> on <hi>this,</hi> who took ſuch a Pet at the other, that, rather than appear like him, he ſtudied how he might be offenſive unto every one, and was well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough pleaſed to be thought an Enemy to all Decency and honeſt Comelineſs; one of a <hi>ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> Gravity, and a <hi>rugged</hi> Behaviour; ſpruce <hi>Ruffillus,</hi> and ſlovenly <hi>Gorgonius:</hi> The Makebates, and the Flatterers: The Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kards <hi>ſtaggering,</hi> thoſe who had loſt their limbs in the Devils ſervice <hi>halting,</hi> and not a few who were carried on Couches and Down-beds: Some (like <hi>Dogs) grinned,</hi> and others <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked;</hi> ſome did <hi>fawn,</hi> and others <hi>bite:</hi> The Fingers of them were <hi>crooked.</hi> and the Tongues of theſe were <hi>forked:</hi> Some had pointed pry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eyes, and others ſcowling ones: Some had them <hi>miſted</hi> with <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and others <hi>bloudſhot</hi> with <hi>Revenge.</hi>

                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:61162:109"/>
                     <p>After I had thus gone on a good way, I fell into the company of ſome that <hi>appeared</hi> to be utter Enemies to the <hi>Devil</hi>'s Kingdom, and therefore I judged my ſelf <hi>ſafe,</hi> and quite <hi>out</hi> of my way to <hi>him.</hi> For theſe were <hi>outwardly</hi> ſo fierce and zealous Oppoſers of him, as to <hi>fight</hi> againſt him (which you will think ſtrange) in ſeveral <hi>Set</hi>-Battels with Powder and Shot. Their manner was to <hi>bring</hi> back thoſe who (they ſaid) were <hi>going</hi> to him, with <hi>Sword</hi> or <hi>Fire:</hi> they would <hi>piſtol</hi> or <hi>faggot</hi> you, if you went not along with them; and cried out, all were <hi>damn'd</hi> and in the way to <hi>Tophet,</hi> that follow'd them not. So now having <hi>their</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, and Atteſtation to the truth thereof, I concluded, it is impoſſible for me not to be <hi>ſav'd:</hi> I ſhall be happy in both Worlds. Then poor deluded I travelled down apace with them, ran merrily and blindly on; till at laſt we met with their Heads, <hi>Merozius, Diotrephes, Santomero, Don Hugo Pedro,</hi> and <hi>Mariana.</hi> But having long before well enough known them by their names, I began to think my ſelf, for all this, never the farther from the Devil. But their beloved Principle, that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is founded in Grace, and that we were the ſole Proprietors of the Earth, kept me from ſtarting back. While I was with them, they uſed to diſcourſe very irreverently of the ſacred Perſon of <hi>Baſilius,</hi> and to rail much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:61162:109"/> the Hereſie (as they called it) of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian.</hi> They talked ſecretly of many myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Intrigues and treacherous Deſigns againſt the Life of our pious Prince; and not onely ſo, but I could hear them cloſely project the Ruine and Fall of all Principalities under Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. I found now that their Plottings were not againſt one peculiar place or Monarch, but againſt Government and Monarchy it ſelf, and the whole Managery of the Univerſe. In ſuch ſymbolical them as theſe, they threatned within the period of a few years, to lay the Northern Lion <hi>Couchant,</hi> to <hi>tranſplant</hi> the Fleur-de-Luces into another Soil, to <hi>pinion</hi> the Wings of the Weſtern Eagle, to <hi>pull down</hi> the Triumphant Croſs, and make the Creſcent Moon <hi>dwindle</hi> into Stars.</p>
                     <p>Thus wiſe did they menace Deſtruction un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to every Land, and boaſted their Readineſs and their Power to lay all Kingdoms into Rubbiſh and Aſhes, and to reduce the whole World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Confuſion, Anarchy, and Chaos; as there approached us Martial men terribly accou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: who lived upon <hi>Bloud and Booty,</hi> and enquired of <hi>us</hi> (not after the beſt <hi>Cauſe,</hi> but) the beſt <hi>Pay.</hi> But as they ruſhed into the Battel, promiſing themſelves great <hi>Honour</hi> and great <hi>Plunder,</hi> ſome of them were <hi>cut off,</hi> and the others were miſerably <hi>mangled.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I cannot omit to tell you of ſome who
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:61162:110"/> were Spectators of this unhappy Tragedy. They reſerved their <hi>Plaudit</hi> for the <hi>laſt</hi> Act, ſiding the mean while with <hi>both</hi> Parties, ſure to <hi>neither;</hi> chriſtening this their Neutrality, Moderation; their Temporizing, Religion. The moſt cunning of whom ſpoke always in <hi>dubious</hi> Terms, leaving themſelves a liberty to expound the ſame, as the <hi>Victory</hi> ſhould decide, and <hi>Times</hi> ſerve.</p>
                     <p>At this <hi>Theoſophus</hi> bad him ſtay; ſo they both perceived afar off a very hot Scuffle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt two Caravans of Pilgrims; one of them, as near as they could gueſs, bearing for their Colours the <hi>Lion</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> rampant, and the other the mild <hi>Lamb</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Theſe laſt, they could ſee, made but ſmall Reſiſtance, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not many, were ſoon routed by the firſt, who were far more numerous. Yonder (ſaid the good man) I fear there is our <hi>Orthodoxus</hi> and <hi>Eubulus,</hi> with their Pilgrims. At which they both for ſome while moſt ſadly wept. But <hi>Theoſophus</hi> deſirous to hear out the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Friend, bad him go on, ſaying he could not be weari'd at the length thereof, or grow unattentive to what he ſo ſweetly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                     <p>Which accordingly <hi>Timotheus</hi> did. After ſo many Scenes of Madneſs (ſaid he) were paſt, I admired to ſee a man that could look <hi>two</hi> ways at <hi>once,</hi> both <hi>behind</hi> and <hi>afore;</hi> whoſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61162:110"/> 
                        <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> and <hi>Admonition</hi> ſhewed the way to <hi>Paradiſe:</hi> whoſe <hi>Life,</hi> to the quite <hi>contrary</hi> place. Sitting in the Chair of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, there he had learnt to ſpeak fluently the Language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the pious Eloquence, the divine Rhetorick of the Bleſſed; while in his more retired Privacies he never but uſed that of <hi>Babylon,</hi> of Pride, Impiety, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; made all his Actions ſuit with the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dioms</hi> of the <hi>Beaſt</hi> and of Hell, the Speech of the Accurſed. Thus going <hi>one</hi> way, he ſtill pointed <hi>another;</hi> and adviſed every body to go in <hi>that,</hi> whilſt he ſhewed them <hi>this.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With him there went a <hi>pack</hi> of griping hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-hearted <hi>Saints,</hi> provided with <hi>double</hi> Tongues and moſt <hi>heavenly</hi> Viſages. Theſe I took for men of <hi>another</hi> World at firſt, (though <hi>not</hi> long) and verily believed again that I was travelling not <hi>up,</hi> but <hi>down</hi> to <hi>Paradiſe;</hi> that we were all certainly trooping <hi>thither.</hi> Do you ſee, then ſaid one, yonder <hi>demure</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſians, caſting up their <hi>ſanctified</hi> looks to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? They that <hi>without</hi> appear as mortified and holy as the Primitive Pilgrims, have <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in</hi> them the Impurities of a Brothel-houſe, and the Covetouſneſs of Uſurers; come, let us go teaz and make ſport at them. Inſtead of being <hi>daunted,</hi> I was mightily <hi>pleaſed,</hi> to diſcover what they were; and began to be <hi>bold</hi> and <hi>confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi> not <hi>afraid,</hi> that I was in the <hi>wrong</hi> way.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:61162:111"/> Seeing them wear the <hi>Image</hi> and the <hi>Livery</hi> of God, every one hated them, and laughed at them, (juſt as we ſhould at <hi>Aſſes</hi> in <hi>Lions,</hi> or <hi>Wolves</hi> in <hi>Sheep</hi> skins; or as we ſhould at <hi>Jackpuddings</hi> in the <hi>Garb</hi> of <hi>Senators.)</hi> We all deteſted their <hi>painted</hi> Sanctity, thought them <hi>Devils</hi> transformed into <hi>Angels of Light;</hi> but we deteſted them not as <hi>Devils,</hi> but as <hi>diſguiſed,</hi> as them who were <hi>aſhamed</hi> of <hi>bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced</hi> Vice.</p>

                     <p>By this time the day grew hot, and <hi>Theoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> perceiving that he was now about to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on a freſh Diſcourſe, told him he might leave off a little while, till they had refreſhed their Senſes, and recruited their Bodies: So they turned back into the Lodge. In their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn homeward, there happened a pretty odde Accident, which was thus: Hearing a Cry, <hi>I will be the death of her,</hi> again and again repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they ſaw a Lady preſently, who <hi>appeared</hi> very beautiful, ride by them upon a fair Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, carrying before her a man bound hand and feet. <hi>Timotheus</hi> ſtraight knew the man to be the effeminate <hi>Philogynus,</hi> whom <hi>Parthenius</hi> was gone to ſeek after. He therefore ſtep'd to him, that he might unbind and ſet him free. But as ſoon as he was taken from the Lady and unbound, he was highly diſpleaſed, and bound himſelf again. It was in vain either for <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motheus</hi> or the old Father to diſſwade him; for they found that he was <hi>deaf,</hi> and could not hear any thing they ſaid: but had he been <hi>onely</hi> ſo, the very <hi>ſight</hi> of <hi>Timotheus</hi> would have been enough to <hi>work upon</hi> him; but he was alſo <hi>blind,</hi> and could not <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>Beauty</hi> and the <hi>Amiableneſs</hi> of a <hi>young Convert.</hi> He was

But after he was diſarm'd, and ſeemed to be very well reconcil'd to her, juſt as <hi>Theoſophus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus</hi> were leaving them, he fell upon her again, calling her <hi>falſe Whore,</hi> tore off her Dreſs, and ſhook her ſo violently, that made her catch at her Hair as it was dropping from her, and was not able to ſave her borrowed Teeth from falling to the ground. So that the Spark <hi>Erotion,</hi> who here overtook her and came in to her Reſcue, was ſtartled to ſee his <hi>fair</hi> Lady <hi>Sirenia</hi> transform'd into a <hi>foul taudry</hi> Quean.</p>

And <hi>ſuch</hi> effects had this (ſaith the Hiſtorian) upon him, that of a debauched lewd Liver, he became the greateſt Saint, the moſt reſolute Profeſſor of <hi>Christ;</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the <hi>World,</hi> putting on ſuch <hi>Weeds</hi> as this poor well-meaning Tract would fain <hi>cloth</hi> its Pilgrim-Reader in. I do moſt heartily wiſh (O that Wiſhes were not <hi>vain!</hi> that what the brave <hi>Timotheus</hi> in the ſame caſe hath ſeen, may, as on <hi>him</hi> it did, ſo (which he prayed for all the days of his Pilgrimage with unut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Groans) on <hi>all thoſe</hi> to whom the Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof ever cometh, work the <hi>like</hi> effect.
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:61162:125"/> O that <hi>hereby</hi> I could <hi>frighten</hi> the <hi>ſtupid</hi> out of his Lethargy of Sin, and <hi>rouſe</hi> him up into a ſenſe of his Condition! O that if <hi>ſuch</hi> an one ſhall turn over theſe leaves, he would ſit down and conſider a while to <hi>what place</hi> he is travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, ask himſelf whether he can <hi>dwell</hi> with <hi>Everlaſting Burnings!</hi> That he would do <hi>ſo much,</hi> if not out of <hi>Religion,</hi> yet out of <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;</hi> leſt he come to feel the <hi>ſame</hi> at <hi>long run,</hi> not in <hi>Viſion,</hi> but <hi>Reality: greater</hi> too perhaps than <hi>this,</hi> and far beyond all <hi>Hyperboles</hi> of <hi>Pain.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My Sleep was ſuch (ſaid the noble and truly pious Convert) as I verily believed it to be <hi>Death;</hi> and a Devil (I thought) taking me up with his Claws, carried me toward the <hi>Burning Lake.</hi> Which, as I drew near, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me to be bounded with ſeven high Banks of <hi>ſolid</hi> and <hi>unconſumed</hi> Fire; and on a ſpatious ſevenfold Gate of rocky and impene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trable <hi>Adamant,</hi> which open'd to us of its own <hi>accord,</hi> I read (with a ſorrowful caſt of mine Eyes) theſe words: <hi>TOPHET IS ORDAI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NED OF OLD; YEA FOR THE WICKED IT IS PREPARED; HE HATH MADE IT LARGE AND DEEP: THE PILE THEREOF IS M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH FIRE, AND M<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH F<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>EL; THE BREATH OF THE LORD LIKE A STREAM OF BRIMSTONE, DOTH ENKINDLE IT.</hi> Iſai. c. 30. v. 33.</p>

                     <p>As ſoon as I was entred I heard a Voice, like <hi>the Voice of Thunder, and the Voice of many Waters,</hi> ſaying, <hi>KEEP THESE SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LS BO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ND IN CHAINS OF DARKNESS <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTIL THE GREAT A<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>DIT OF THE LORD:</hi> and another, <hi>LET HOT B<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RNING COALS FALL <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>PON THEM, LET THEM BE CAST INTO THE FIRE, AND INTO THE PIT, THAT THEY NEVER RISE <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>P AGAIN.</hi> And looking back, I ſaw great Multitudes behind me, ruſhing in at the Gate, who were bound preſently, and <hi>cast into the Lake.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A wild Waſt methought it was of inextin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhable <hi>Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Naphtha;</hi> whereon, as far as ever I could ken, lay rowling hopeleſs <hi>Peoples</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> that ſtriving to <hi>blow</hi> it <hi>out,</hi> made it <hi>burn</hi> the <hi>more,</hi> and <hi>kept</hi> it <hi>burning.</hi> Whence <hi>intolerable</hi> Smoak, with <hi>gloomy</hi> Flakes of <hi>unlightſome</hi> flame were ſcattered upwards, and darkened round the wide Coaſt.

It was, I remember, every where ſo <hi>black</hi> and <hi>diſmal</hi> a <hi>Night,</hi> as <hi>plagu'd Egypt</hi> ſure felt not: ſuch a Night as could not be brooded even on the face of Chaos: an <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,</hi> a <hi>ſmart,</hi> a <hi>boundleſs,</hi> and a <hi>never-ending.</hi>
                        <pb n="239" facs="tcp:61162:126"/> (I concluded) Night; <hi>palpable</hi> almoſt to the <hi>Touch.</hi> But how vain am I, that I ſtrive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it!

                     <p>Keeping therefore upon wing.

                     <p>They were both ready to ſink to the ground, which made him here break off abruptly. But it is impoſſible (ſaid he, as the Father was fainting) for me to recount the Torments and Terrors of this Gloomy Proſpect: nor do I care to fill your ears too long (which I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid yet I have already done) with ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Relations as theſe. A more particular Enumeration of what I ſaw, will ſerve for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Melancholy Diſcourſe; as, whatſoever I dreamed concerning the Inhabitants of <hi>Sodom, Jezabel, Iſcariot, Herod, Simon Magus, Nero, Mahomet,</hi> and their peculiar and appropriate Tortures, as likewiſe <hi>theirs</hi> with whom on the Road I came acquainted; concerning alſo the Book of <hi>Death,</hi> the Dungeon of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> the <hi>Cataracts</hi> and <hi>Whirlwinds</hi> of Fire, the Conſults of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his <hi>Peers</hi> about the Subverſion of the <hi>Anglican</hi> Church, the uneaſie and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Diſports</hi> of the Devils, the <hi>Helliſhneſs</hi> of Vice, whence every one was made his own Executioner to kill and torment himſelf, and how <hi>Tophet</hi> is not onely the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> of ſin, but that ſin naturally ſets it <hi>on fire;</hi> and many other things which I dream'd of, that may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in their place to be remembred.</p>
                     <p>Now as the Fiends (methoughts) were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:61162:128"/> to bind me, and as I was a dropping down apace, a glorious heavenly Youth cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched me. At which I awaked; when I found at my head my dear Monitor <hi>Eubulus,</hi> that at my firſt <hi>entrance</hi> into the Road, and ſeveral times afterward, <hi>warned</hi> me of this. He ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched me away haſtily. So I followed him; but not without <hi>looking back:</hi> And were God ſo ſevere as to mark what is done amiſs, I ſhould <hi>even</hi> then (with <note n="*" place="margin">Jude v. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Lot</hi>'s Wife, leaving the Cities Plagu'd with <hi>the Vengeance of eternal Fire)</hi> have been made an <hi>everlaſting</hi> Monument of this.</p>
                     <p>We opportunely met with an old man called <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who directed us to your Lodge. But as we were in ſight of this tuft of Trees, I was torn away from my <hi>Eubulus,</hi> by my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions that I had left in the <hi>Broad</hi> Road; who as ſoon as they diſcover'd my <hi>Flight,</hi> came thus far in <hi>purſuit</hi> after me. Theſe were they who then putting on the Viſors of Religion, left me in that woful Plight, in which you, my deareſt Father, found me. Next after God, to you I owe this <hi>Breath:</hi> I owe to you my <hi>Self,</hi> my <hi>Life,</hi> or if any thing can be <hi>dearer</hi> to me than my <hi>Self</hi> or my <hi>Life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He had ſcarce made an end, before <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxus</hi> came to enquire after <hi>Eubulus.</hi> To him, after a ſhort ſtay, <hi>Theoſophus</hi> committed his young Pilgrim; himſelf tarrying behind
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:61162:128"/> for others that were to come after.
